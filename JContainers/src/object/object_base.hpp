    - object has owners (another objects), gets exposed, returned to Skyrim for the first time. If an object will be unlinked from another object-owner,
      @release will be called, and if RC is 0 then lifetime will be prolonged

    STOP prolong if:

    - an object gets retained by a user
    - an object gets retained by another object
